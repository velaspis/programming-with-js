Programming with JS

This repository contains the final project that I completed as a part of my Meta Professional Front End Dev Certificate program in the programming JS section. In this project, I have written examples of working JavaScript code, which can be useful for learning JS programming concepts.

Prerequisites
This project requires a basic understanding of JavaScript programming concepts. You should also have a code editor and a browser installed on your system to run and test the examples.

Usage
The examples in this project are organized by topic, and each topic contains one or more examples of working JS code. You can open the HTML file in the examples folder and test the code by opening the console in your browser.
